## Welcome to the Stone age repository.

This mod gives you the feeling of being a man from the stone age. No more magically created planks from wood logs; the way to your first crafting table is long and dangerous. In prehistoric ages, animals were not domesticated, and the same applies to this mod. There are no cows, sheeps, pigs, or chickens. Instead you'll find their ancestors (aurochs, mouflons, boars, and fowls), all of whom are quit upset when you attack them or their friends.
